<p>National Integration is the feeling of togetherness or oneness towards one’s own country irrespective of their individual differences with regard to religion, region, race, culture or caste.</p>

<p>India is a multi-racial and multilingual country. These diversities are the feature of India. But the culture of India makes her people feel that they are the children of mother India. India is an excellent example of ‘Unity in Diversity‘. Foreign invasions and conquests from time to time, could not crush the spirit of unity of culture.</p>

<p>In ancient times, India was divided in many small Kingdoms and the kings of these Kingdoms were engaged in fighting with each other for political power. But there was not the issue of religion. In the last century when British was ruling over India and the Indian people began their movement against the British ruler for the freedom of their motherland. The ruler tried to disturb the national integration of our country by applying the ‘divide and rule’ policy to curb the movement. In pursuance of that policy they began to show their favor alternatively to this community or that. In this way they had sown the seeds of misunderstanding and jealousy in the minds of the people.</p>

<p>Presently, in many parts of India, people are continuing their demand for division on the basis of language and religion. In the root of these agitations we can see that the poverty and illiteracy of the general people make them agitated and their agitations are colored as the freedom movement. If the Indian economy develops sufficiently and if the general people can pass their lives happily the agitations will stop automatically.</p>

<p>"Ek sur" (One Tune) (languages of India), or "Mile Sur Mera Tumhara" as it is better known, is an Indian song and accompanying video promoting national integration and unity in diversity.</p>

<p>The concept for Mile Sur was developed in 1988 by Lok Seva Sanchar Parishad and promoted by Doordarshan (then India's sole TV broadcaster) and India's Ministry of Information. The song was composed by Ashok Patki and arranged by Louis Banks, with lyrics by Piyush Pandey (then an Account Manager and presently the Executive Chairman and Creative Head of Ogilvy and Mather, India). The project was conceived by Suresh Mallik and kailash surendranath and directed by kailash surendranath and recorded by people from all walks of life, including a supergroup of Indian celebrities—musicians, sports persons, movie stars, etc.</p>

<p>The national integration video was intended to instill a sense of pride and promote unity amongst Indians, highlighting India's different linguistic communities and societies—India's unity in diversity, so to speak. Mile Sur was telecast for the first time on Independence Day 1988, after the telecast of the Prime Minister’s speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort.</p>

<p>It quickly captivated India, gaining and maintaining near-anthem status ever since.</p>

<p>It had many languages. Hindi (Bhimsenji and Lataji's parts, among others), and alphabetically the others were : Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Marathi, Marwari, Oriya, Punjabi, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. (Among the languages present, then in 1988, in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India).</p>

<p>India is a well known country especially for the oldest civilization in the world where people of many ethnic groups lived together for years. India is a country of diverse ethnicities where people have used almost 1650 languages and dialects according to their religion and choice. In spite of being related from different cultures, traditions, religions and languages; people here respect each other and live together with lots of love and feeling of brotherhood. People living here and all over the India are joined together by one faith of brotherhood. Unity in Diversity has been one of the great characteristic of our nation which has bound people of all religions together in one bond of humanity.</p>

<p>We can never forget the freedom movements run by the people of all religions of India to make India an independent country. The struggle for freedom is the great example of unity in diversity in India.</p>

<p>Unity in diversity concept in India gives everyone a strong message that nothing is without unity. Living together with love and harmony provides the real essence of life. Unity in diversity in India shows us that we all are born, cared and nourished by one, it talks about how all of us are one and that it isn't about who is right or wrong, rather it's about being together.</p>
